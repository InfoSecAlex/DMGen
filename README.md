# DMGen
Python-based D&amp;D random generator for DMs, by a DM.

This is a project to create an easy and fast generator for various suitable for my D&D DMing needs.

DMGen's planned features include:
    -Generating a fully fledged NPC on the fly with seeding functionality, including:
        name
        sex
        race
        profession
        unique attributes (scars, mannerisms, and other 'flavor')

    -Generating various places, such as taverns, shops, and the like, including:
        names
        unique attributes (architecture)
        the people that inhabit, work at, or frequent the place

        Places will generally be city or town relevant locations, not 'adventure hook' locales.

    Also potentially in scope will be:
        enemy generation: random encounters, potentially with a seed.
        Quick plot hook generation, potentially with a seed.


Principles of design:
    Python 3. This project will not support Python 2, Ruby, or other languages.
    DMGen should be fast, easy to understand, customizable, and portable.
    DMGen will ALWAYS be free to use or modify for private use. See 'Terms and Conditions' below.
    DMGen will likely not have a GUI - I intend to use it personally on Linux CLI environments.
    DMGen will respect the proprietary nature of many D&D assets, often owned by Wizards of the Coast.
    DMGen will stay as unobfuscated, open-source, and easy to modify as possible.

All this being said, I am not a professional developer at this point in my career. This is a 'for-fun' and practice
project. Any constructive criticism is welcome! I hope you try it out and use it, and that this software enriches
your DMing experience and that of your players.
